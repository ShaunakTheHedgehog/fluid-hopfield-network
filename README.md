# fluid-hopfield-network
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Fluid Hopfield Network, which is a model for retrieving stored memories. It an extension of the Modern Hopfield Network, that assigns dynamically-updating slope parameters to each vector that is stored in the network; then, when partial / incomplete memories are passed into the network, the model quickly and robustly retrieves the corresponding completed memory vector that was stored in the network!
